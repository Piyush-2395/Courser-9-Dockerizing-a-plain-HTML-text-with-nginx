To dockerize a static file and host it with Nginx, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project.
2. Use a base image that includes Nginx, such as `nginx:latest`.
3. Copy your static files into the Docker image using the `COPY` command.
4. Optionally, you can customize the Nginx configuration by replacing the default configuration file with your own.
5. Expose the appropriate port (usually port 80) using the `EXPOSE` command.
6. Start Nginx by using the `CMD` command to run the `nginx` executable.

To push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or the AWS Management Console. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Build the Docker image locally using the `docker build` command.
2. Tag the image with the ECR repository URI.
3. Authenticate your Docker CLI to the ECR registry using the `aws ecr get-login-password` command.
4. Push the image to ECR using the `docker push` command.

To run the Docker image on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or AWS Fargate, you need to create a task definition and a service. Here's a simplified process:

1. Create a task definition that specifies the Docker image, resource requirements, and other settings.
2. Create a service that uses the task definition and defines the desired number of tasks to run.
3. Configure the service to use either ECS or Fargate launch type.
4. Optionally, configure load balancers, auto scaling, and other advanced settings.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and there are many more details and configurations involved in each step. I recommend referring to the official documentation for more detailed instructions and examples.
